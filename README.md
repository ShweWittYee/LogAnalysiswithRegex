This script is written,as a part of graded course assessment of Google Python sub-course 2 ( Using python to interact with the operating system), 
that generates two different reports from this internal ticketing system log file i.e., syslog.log. 
This script will create the following reports:
    1) The ranking of errors generated by the system: 
    A list of all the error messages logged and how many times each error was found, sorted by the most common error to the least common error. 
    2) The user usage statistics for the service:
    A list of all users that have used the system, including how many info messages and how many error messages they've generatedand sorted by username.
